<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! It's a pleasure to have you in my first website. I'm Jhonathas do Nascimento, currently an English Teacher and a Web Developer in formation.</p>

<p>I'm from Brazil and I have a lot to show to the world. Probably I'm going to change career and dive into web development. It's so cool! </p>

<p>So, help me in this journey and let's sail together in this new adventure. Maybe I can even get a good new job. If you feel that you have seen a similar web page, it's because I'm learning from Angela Yu's course on Udemy. Cheers!</p>
